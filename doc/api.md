## Lua API Reference ##

The Lua API consists out of several modules. For linear algebra operations, we provide bindings to the C++ library, [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html), in the `glm` module. Various values related to the keyboard and mouse, are stored in the [keyboard](keyboard_api.md) and [mouse](mouse_api.md) modules. Finally, and most importantly, the [scene](scene_api.md) module contains functionality for manipulating the scene as well as various objects for building a scene and displaying text on the screen.
